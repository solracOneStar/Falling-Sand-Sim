# Falling Sand Simulation!

#### video demo:

## Description
This falling sand simulator was made using Pygame.ce 2.5.5!

What is pygame?
Pygame-ce is a free open-source Python library used primarily for making games! It's built upon the SDL libary for use of a computers graphics, audio and input devices!

How I used Pygame:
I used Pygames ability to handle input, as well as its ability to render graphics for this project. Getting both mouse and keyboard input to render sand and stone. As well as getting input for erasing the grid and completely clearing it

## Project Structure
- project.py # Pygame setup, main logic, and game loop
- grid.py # Handles grid logic
- particle.py # Handles particle logic (sand, rock)
- simulation.py # Handles core game logic (adding/removing particles, and input)
- test_project.py # Project Unit tests
- requirements.txt # Project dependencies
- README.md # Project doc
